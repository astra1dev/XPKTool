</p>

Supported games:

It can be used to modify the game assets that are packed in the .xpk file.

- Added support for Linux and MacOS
- Upgrade to .NET Runtime version 8
- Refactored and improved code
- Faster speed and smaller file size

# 💾 Installation
The following operating systems are supported:
- Windows (64-bit, 32-bit, ARM64-based)
- Linux (64-bit, 64-bit with musl libc, ARM-based, ARM64-based, )
- macOS (64-bit and ARM64-based (Apple Silicon))

1. Download and install .NET 8 from the [official site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) if you don't already have it installed.
2. Download the file fitting your operating system from the [latest release](../releases/latest)

- The compiled exe will be located here: `src/bin/Debug/net8.0/XPKTool.exe`

# 🛠️ Usage
- To unpack: Drop a .XPK FILE on the executable or run `XPKTool.exe FILE.xpk`.
- To repack: Drop a FOLDER on the executable or run `XPKTool.exe FOLDER`.
